# Automation_to_join_google_meet_automatically
An python automation system to join in the meetings hosted on google meet automatically on given time.

'This is a project made only for learning purpose.'

The project is made on python and only supports python3.x. The lower versions are not supported.
Modules used:
-------------
1. pyautogui
2. time
3. webbrowser


The mouse functions of pyautogui are used so the it may vary from screen sizes.
Currently, it is supported only on windows, linux, mac os x and rashpberian platforms.
But only I have tested it on windows platform.

The user just need to provide the time of meeting and the link when ask, and left it. It will automatically joins the user to the meeting with camera and mic off.
In addition if the user is a host then it will automatically gives entry to the members requesting to join.

#Its working fine in my device but not tested on any other device.
#As pyautogui module's mouse functions are used, it is depends on the screen resolution. Means it may vary from screen sizes.
#Looking forward to add other features and also fix bugs.
